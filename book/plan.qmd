# Course plan {#sec-plan}

For fall semester 2023.

## Block 1: Introduction to Applied Geodata Science methods {.unnumbered}

This first block serves to recap essential machine learning methods that will be applied in the tutorials of subsequent blocks, and to recap methods for implementing a reproducible data science workflow in the form that will be required for the submission of the self-guided project report.

Contents are covered in the [Applied Geodata Science book](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/).

### Session 1 - 21.09. {.unnumbered}

- [The data science workflow and data science basics](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/introduction.html#the-data-science-workflow)
- [The concept of modelling](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/introduction.html#a-new-modelling-paradigm)
- Applications of machine learning in Geography and Earth system sciences (lecture)

### Session 2 - 28.09. {.unnumbered}

### Session 3 - 05.10. {.unnumbered}

- [Random Forest](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/randomforest.html)
- Interpretable machine learning

## Block 2: Phenology modelling {.unnumbered}

*Lead: Koen Hufkens*

In both Block 2 and 4 I will focus on a set of examples which are rather limited in spatial scope, using just a handfull of pixels. In contrast to what the cloud computing revolution promised, many ideas start out from site or localized studies. The focus of these few chapters from the [Handful of Pixels](https://geco-bern.github.io/handfull_of_pixels/phenology_modelling.html) book is deliberate. I will show you through both examples in vegetation seasonality (phenology) and land-use and land-cover mapping (Block 4) that you can experiment with geo-spatial data on limited compute infrastructure. Furthermore, it also shows you that true science can be done with relatively modest means. You will learn to do big science with small data.

### Session 5 - 19.10. {.unnumbered}

- Introduction to phenology modelling
- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

### Session 6 - 26.10. {.unnumbered}

- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

## Block 3: Digital soil mapping {.unnumbered}

[Link to tutorial](https://padasch.github.io/digital_soil_mapping/)

[TBC: context]

### Session 7 - 02.11. {.unnumbered}

- Introduction to digital soil mapping
- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

### Session 8 - 09.11. {.unnumbered}

- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

## Block 4: Land cover classification {.unnumbered}

*Lead: Koen Hufkens*

In this section I introduce [Land-Use and Land-Cover mapping](https://geco-bern.github.io/handfull_of_pixels/land_cover_classification.html). It shows how to train a Land-Use and Land-Cover machine learning algorithm and scale these results to a larger region. The exercises include an amicable competitive component, where a better model needs to be created and results submitted to a leaderboard (see @sec-leaderboard for details).

### Session 9 - 16.11. {.unnumbered}

- Introduction to land cover classification
- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

### Session 10 - 23.11. {.unnumbered}

- Self-study of tutorial and exercises

## Report exercise 1: Spatial upscaling {.unnumbered}

See @sec-upscaling

### Session 11 - 30.11. {.unnumbered}

- Self-study of literature and report exercise

### Session 12 - 07.12. {.unnumbered}

- Self-study of literature and report exercise

## Report exercise 2: Self-guided project {.unnumbered}
