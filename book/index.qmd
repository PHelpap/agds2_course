# About this course {.unnumbered}

## Course description 

This course consolidates essential methods of the data science workflow, introduced in the course Applied Geodata Science I and the book [Applied Geodata Science](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/) and demonstrates common applications of machine learning methods in Geography and Environmental Sciences by worked examples.

## Learning objectives

- Implement a data science workflow for common domain-specific machine learning-based modelling tasks.
- Analyse and visualise models and their predictions and communicate insights.
- Describe the challenges of model fitting and evaluate model generalisability in the context of the prediction task.
- Adopt and benefit from Open Science practices and resources for data-intensive research projects.

## Target audience and prerequisites

Master students in *Geography* and in *Climate Sciences* at the University of Bern. 

Students are expected to master contents taught in *480094 Applied Geodata Science I*. If AGDS I has not been attended, it is expected that equivalent knowledge has been gained from comparable courses in other study programs, or that contents of the [*Applied Geodata Science book*](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/) are independently studied until October 12, 2023 (before the fourth session in fall semester 2023).

The lead for this course is by by Prof. [Benjamin Stocker](https://geco-group.org/author/benjamin-stocker/) and co-taught with  [Dr. Koen Hufkens](https://geco-group.org/author/koen-hufkens/). The website is a product of the group for [Geocomputation and Earth Observation](https://geco-group.org/), Institute of Geography, University of Bern. Individual tutorials are co-authored by different contributors.
