# About this course {.unnumbered}

## Course description 

This course consolidates essential methods of the data science workflow, introduced in the course Applied Geodata Science I and the book [Applied Geodata Science](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/) and demonstrates common applications of machine learning methods in Geography and Environmental Sciences by worked examples.

## Learning objectives

- Implement a data science workflow for common domain-specific machine learning-based modelling tasks.
- Analyse and visualise models and their predictions and communicate insights.
- Describe the challenges of model fitting and evaluate model generalisability.
- Adopt and benefit from Open Science practices and resources for data-intensive research projects.

## Course contents

After a recap of Applied Geodata Science basics, a set of common applications of machine learning methods in Geography and Environmental Science are introduced. Applications cover a wide diversity of data science methods and serve to demonstrate fundamental concepts and implementations, including mechanistic modelling, unsupervised classification, and supervised machine learning. The course combines a theoretical and a hands-on component and consists of a mixture of lectures, exercises, and a (small) self-guided project.

See [Course Plan](@sec-plan) for a complete overview and contextualisation of the different applications.

## Exam modalities

Students hand in the report of the self-guided projects, submitted in the form of a reproducible workflow (code repository). See [Logistics](@sec-logistics) for more information.

## Target audience and prerequisites

Master students in *Geography* and in *Climate Sciences* at the University of Bern. 

Students are expected to master contents taught in *480094 Applied Geodata Science I*. If AGDS I has not been attended, it is expected that equivalent knowledge has been gained from comparable courses in other study programs, or that contents of the [*Applied Geodata Science book*](https://geco-bern.github.io/agds/) are independently studied until October 12, 2023 (before the fourth session in fall semester 2023).

This course is a product of the group for [Geocomputation and Earth Observation](https://geco-group.org/), Institute of Geography, led by Prof. Benjamin Stocker, with contributions by Dr. Koen Hufkens and Pascal Schneider.
